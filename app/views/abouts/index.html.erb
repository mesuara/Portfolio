Hi there, <br>
I started learning to code on my own a few years ago (C++, JavaScript). I’ve finished my program with the New York City Tech Pipeline, where I’ve done programming with JavaScript and Ruby.

<br>
<br>
Currently, I’m working on my personal projects built with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I also am working with The Knowledge House as a Teacher Assistant for the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering high school. As I got exposed to coding and the things I could do with it the more I wanted to explore. Now that I finished my bootcamp, I'm taking a course in Python so I can learn about data and machine learning.
<br>
<br>
With over 5 years of work experience in customer-facing roles for companies that include the US Tennis Association, I've had the chance to work with people from different backgrounds. Which has led me to amazing new opportunities and I've learned a lot from them.
